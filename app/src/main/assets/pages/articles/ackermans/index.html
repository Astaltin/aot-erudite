                <p>The Ackerman clan, also known as Ackerman family is an Eldian family living within the Walls.
                    Traditionally,
                    they were a bloodline of warriors that protected Eldia's king, but were persecuted to the brink of
                    extinction after refusing to follow Karl Fritz's ideology. Only two known members are left.</p>

                <section class="article__section">
                    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>

                    <p>The Ackermans lived in Eldia prior to the erection of the Walls. They were the accidental result
                        of
                        the
                        Eldian Empire's experiments with the Subjects of Ymir and Titan science. They were designed to
                        protect
                        Eldia's king, and acted as the monarchy's right hand, entrusted with the survival of their
                        people.
                        After
                        the
                        Eldian Empire collapsed during the Great Titan War a century ago, the family moved inside the
                        Walls
                        that
                        King Fritz created for the Eldians to live in.When the King erased the memories of the people
                        inside
                        using
                        the power of the Founding Titan, the Ackermans were among those immune to it; the others
                        included
                        the
                        Oriental clan and those who would later become the noble families inside the Walls. However,
                        along
                        with
                        the
                        Asian clan, they rejected the King's idea of peace, and turned their backs on the monarchy.
                        Fearing
                        his
                        inability to control them, the King persecuted them, bringing both races to the brink of
                        extinction.
                        In
                        the
                        end, the head of the Ackerman clan offered his own life to ensure the survival of the bloodline
                        and
                        was
                        executed. The rest of the generation avoided telling their children about the world before the
                        Walls
                        in
                        order to protect them from the monarchy's purge. As a result, the following generations grew up
                        without
                        that
                        knowledge.</p>

                <section class="article__section">
                    <h2 class="h2">Awakened Power</h2>

                    <p>The Ackermans have an "awakened power" displayed by some members of the clan. Levi Ackerman
                        describes
                        it
                        as knowing exactly what needs to be done, and it lets the Ackermans exhibit physical abilities
                        much,
                        much higher than the average human. Eren Yeager learns from Zeke that this is because they were
                        the
                        result of the old Eldian Empire experimenting with the Subjects of Ymir. They can manifest the
                        power
                        of
                        the Titans as humans, without becoming a Titan or inheriting any of the Nine Titans. When
                        awakened,
                        the
                        Ackerman in question gains the combined battle experience from every single Ackerman before them
                        via
                        paths.</p>

                    <p>Despite this power being a tremendous asset, it is not automatically active and has to be
                        triggered
                        through survival instinct. For example, Mikasa was a normal girl until the age of 9 when three
                        robbers
                        killed her parents and kidnapped her. Eren came to her rescue, and when they were facing death,
                        he
                        told
                        her to "fight." This awakened Mikasa's dormant power, and she was able to kill one of the
                        criminals
                        with
                        a single stab, crush the knife's handle with her bare hands, and snap the floorboards with the
                        strength
                        of her foot. Levi has stated that both Kenny and himself also had similar moments that awakened
                        their
                        powers.Eren Yeager once made the claim to Mikasa that the conditions of unlocking the potential
                        of
                        the
                        Ackerman bloodline are to find a host, and when facing death, to obey an order from the host.
                        This
                        will
                        activate the state found in the Ackerman's blood to protect the host. By Eren's claim, an
                        awakened
                        Ackerman is forced to serve their host, and they experience sudden headaches if their "true
                        self"
                        tries
                        to resist. However, these details were fabricated by Eren, as Zeke Yeager had no knowledge as to
                        the
                        origin of Mikasa's headaches or the validity of the idea that an awakened Ackerman requires a
                        host.
                        Armin Arlert rightly speculated that Eren was lying and used Mikasa's headaches to support his
                        claim,
                        and it is Zeke's belief that Mikasa's protective nature over Eren came from her love for him and
                        not
                        a
                        predisposed inclination.</p>

                    <h2 class="h2">Immunity to the Founding Titan</h2>

                    <p>The Ackermans are Subjects of Ymir and could manifest within Paths; however, they were immune to
                        the
                        Founding Titan's ability to alter memories. This led Kenny's grandfather to speculate that they
                        were
                        not
                        Subjects of Ymir as the majority race within the Walls were affected. The Ackermans were also
                        incapable
                        of transforming into Pure Titans.</p>
